# Automated Real Estate Data Extraction System (UiPath)

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an automated system using **UiPath** to collect and analyze real estate property data from online listing websites. The automation is designed to streamline the process of searching properties by location, extracting relevant details, filtering results based on cost, and delivering a consolidated analysis to the user via email.
By eliminating manual data collection and comparison, the system improves efficiency, reduces human error, and enables faster, data-driven decision-making for property evaluation.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop an automated UiPath-based solution that:
* Searches for real estate properties on online listing websites based on a user-entered location.
* Extracts essential property details such as **property name**, **location**, and **price**.
* Stores the extracted data in **Microsoft Excel** for structured analysis.
* Applies **cost-based filtering** to identify properties within a specified price range.
* Sends the complete filtered analysis to the user via **automated email**.

This solution aims to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and provide a faster and more reliable way to compare real estate properties.
